// we use two pointers approach and by traverisng the array we check for our confition. first we only checkl for elements rathera than zero
as only those elementts are required. WE need to find the zeroes between them.

class Solution {
    public int captureForts(int[] forts) {

        int max= 0; 
        int prev = -1;
        for(int  i = 0; i<forts.length; i++){
            if(  forts[i] != 0){
                if(prev != -1 && forts[i] != forts[prev] ){
                    max = Math.max(max , i - prev - 1);
                } 
                prev = i;
            }
        }
